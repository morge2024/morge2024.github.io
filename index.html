This was what Millie had been looking forward to all through wedding planning. We had fruity ice cream at a place recommended by Ewan Lusty and it was amazing, highlight so far. We're absolutely shattered."

    "text": "A beautiful day in Bologna! Completed a walking tour: medieval Bologna with its multiple towers was wiillld. I had an amazing peach and raspberry spritz with traditional filled breads for lunch. We saw the birth place of anatomical studies. We had more fruity ice cream. We went up to Santa Luca Basilica and then walked down. I had the best pasta of my life for dinner. I don't want to leave Bologna tomorrow!"

Hillary from Cardiff bought us drinks at the chicetti place. She was a laugh! We had an amble about the island in the dark and it was magical"

We took a boat along the Grand Canal, went to the Doge's palace, Millie's first married stately home trip: and George wasnt upset! Then dinner somewhere we sent another honeymooning couple."

    "text": "St Mark's Basilica was so impressive. It's so hard to believe how old it is. The Medieval villagers must have been transported, even in this day and age it's spectacular. They must have thought it miraculous! We went to the museum, which required a walk along a high up gangway and worn away staircase. Heart was very much in mouth. Thanks to the museum we saw the bronze horses from the 2nd century BC, they used a technique of casting now lost to us. The naturalism of the sculpture was transportive. They could have been made yesterday! Then we waited for the boat to Murano. On the island, Millie bought her first Hugo spritz which was delicious. She also bought a Murano glass hair Barette that she hopes will always remind her of honeymoon. This was the first day we really felt the drag of tourism in Venice. Lots and lots of people. For dinner we picked a place recommended by our tour guide which does White Russians. Very tasty food and drink but the place felt like a library inside. Very strange vibes."

    "text": "We had an 'interesting' breakfast of the world cooked breakfast in one of the historic cafes right on one of the key piazzas. Then we hopped on a local train to Mirama, almost failed to get off but the train waited for us! Miramare fulfilled all Millie's stately home dreams and was a selfless pick from George. Gorgeous grounds and views! In the afternoon we sampled the local sweet pastry and had an afternoon cafe hopping."

    "text": "An early morning coach and a whistlestop tour of Lublijana later, we were in a 7 peson car to Lake Bled. Slightly bizarre. Lake Bled is living up to all George's dreams. We're enjoying the relaxing experience if being in a hotel. Swimming in the pool with the panoramic view of the lake while the sun sets behind the mountain is a honeymoon highlight. The truffle steak in the Bled Old Cellar was the best meal yet. We've booked to go again today!"

The trains were so romantic, lovely to see the world go by, and fun in one to squish ourselves into an old fashioned compartment already full of tourists. We had a traditional dinner and the waitor was very nice about Millie's attempts at German"

They really like Empress Sisi here, we do not get the hype, we want more Empress Maria Theresa hype! Mozart's apartment museum was a surprisingly well curated space! More details on requesr"

Despite the tour guides advice to give it a miss we had a very nice time. Most of the day we spent at SchÃ¶nbrum palace. It was majestic! We loved the sculpture in the garden with fake heiroglythics because it was built before they were translated! NachMarkt was good fun for a drink and George's requested big sausage. We capped the day with a trip to the Vienna Opera House to see Salome. A better experience than we had both feared!"

A quick wizz round the Albertina so George could view the Franz Marc there. Train was not as picturesque. We dressed up for posh drinks and dinner under a historic bell! In a tower!"
